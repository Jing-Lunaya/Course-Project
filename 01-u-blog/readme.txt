Dear teacher:

This is the web blog project:

1. The first blog page and Home page is linked to click.

2 the structure is set by grid, and inside I use flex to align some card item.

3. the blog post page has a background img at the subtitle area,  and below the content has an Author area

4. the social link area is at footer^_^


A few little details I feel I could improve more and better, but I want to submit it in time. and keep practice later through out the course.

1. footer forum area: How to make checkbox some distances to the text next to it?

2. I would like to write css a bit more cleaner and simpler, but this maybe take some more practice to achive....



at the end.


Thank you for your evaluate this code,
and have a joyful and wonderful day.
